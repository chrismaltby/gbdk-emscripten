v0.1 (980707)
-------------
* Initial release

v0.15 (980827)
--------------
* Added INCBIN, INCLUDE and DF support
  It's not very robust at the moment...

v0.16 (981213)
--------------
* Added INCIHX support

v0.17 (981220)
--------------
* Made a few changes to the state table to make both

	A = B+C		; With whitespace at the front
	.include "fish"	; Ditto
	.even

and
A = B+C			; No whitespace
.include "fish"
.even
	valid.  There could be some trouble with Pascal's
'.label:' style, and the '.include' style, and also with the
'A =' style and the macro definition style.  Macros can not
start with a '.' due to these changes.

v0.21 (981230)
--------------
* Added style support.  Current styles are jas and asgb
* Fixed up text support.  Can now have "" and '' strings
* Fixed up the whitespace eater for opcode arguments. The line:
	Fish Cat Bob-Fred
  was becoming
	Fish CatBob-Fred
  It now becomes (with a post-appended space between normal text)
	Fish Cat Bob -Fred
* Lots of other fixes.

v0.22 (990102)
--------------
* Added ' to the SOPCODE_ARGS loopback to handle af,af'
